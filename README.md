The web designer reviewed the requirements and created the following wireframe diagram to provide the team with a visual representation of how the web page should look after it is developed. Take some time to study the wireframe, and pay particular attention to the items in red.

This wireframe diagram documents the complete layout of every design element the completed web page should include, such as:

- The title of the web page, example tasks with checkboxes, and buttons
- The distances that elements should be from each other in pixels (px)
- The width of some elements as a percentage of their container
- The colors for some elements using a hexadecimal code that is used in stylesheets for color
